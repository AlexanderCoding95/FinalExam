The main point is to create three threads that perform different tasks on a  shared array of integers. The Generator thread fills the array with random  numbers, the Sorter thread sorts the array in ascending order, and the  Drainer thread clears the array. The threads have to run in a synchronized  fashion. To achieve this synchronization, we use the wait() and notifyAll()  methods of the Object class, which allow the threads to talk to each other  and coordinate their actions. We also use a boolean by the name of sorted  to indicate if the array has been sorted or not, so that the threads can  check this requirement before performing their duty. The Simulation class  contains the array and the flag as its fields, and also provides a print  method to display the contents of the array after each thread does its job. The main idea of the Producer - Consumer method is for the Producer to  add numbers to some shared data structure and the consumer is required  to remove the numbers from that structure. The buffer is used as a queue.  It is a classic example of a multi-threaded synchronization. There are tasks  consuming data and tasks producing data concurrently.
